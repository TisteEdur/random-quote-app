# Random Quote App Exercise

<p>This is a repository for a simple quote generator app.</p>

<p>The quote generator is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I've tried to make the design look modern and simple.</p>

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to practice JavaScript & CSS. 
Didn't have any major setbacks for this exercise.</p>

#### The Quote API I used for the app is from [Luke Peavey](https://github.com/lukePeavey) - [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable?tab=readme-ov-file#get-random-quotes)
#### Icons: Shout out to [Stickers](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/stickers) for the cool [icons](https://www.flaticon.com/stickers-pack/school-745) I've used for the app.
